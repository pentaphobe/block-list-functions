# Some handy functional set routines

There are a few common tasks which I find myself unable to do with standard `map`, `reduce`, and `filter`.

This is likely a shortcoming of my understanding, rather than the methods themselves - but nonetheless I decided to finally write up some of them.

## To do

- [ ] Proper readme with examples
- [ ] Break the file into useful portions for reuse
- [ ] More documentation
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Seriously.  Add *lots* of examples.

## History

- 20160407 Initial git commit
- 20160405 Tested assumptions, rejoiced
